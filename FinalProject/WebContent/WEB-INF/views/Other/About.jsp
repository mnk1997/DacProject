    <p style="font-size: larger; padding: 80px; padding-top: 0%;">As a part of CDAC ,the common issue which most of the student faced was in Assignment Upload and Evaluation.

        Not having a specific platform , restricts us from giving as well as receiving the feedback of the assignments 
        A specific online platform can help us to achieve the solution to this problem so we designed this "Assignment Evaluation System".
